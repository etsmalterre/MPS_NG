# Worktree Status Skill

## When to use

Invoke with `/worktree-status` to see every active feature worktree at a glance — across
**both** projects (MPS_NG and MPS-TRM): which slot it's on (TRM slots show as `trm:N`),
its project, whether its servers are alive, whether the web port is actually serving, how
far the branch is ahead/behind `origin/master`, and which slots are free per project
(NG and TRM have disjoint port ranges — `300N`/`808N` vs `517N`). Run it anywhere (it reads
the shared registry at `~/.claude/mps-worktrees.json`).

## Steps

1. **Run the status script:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/worktree/status.mjs
   ```
   (Run an optional `git -C C:/dev/etsmalterre/MPS_NG fetch origin -q` first if you want the
   ahead/behind counts to reflect the very latest `master`.)

2. **Relay the output** to the user: the per-slot health (UP / PARTIAL / DOWN), URLs,
   branch divergence, and the list of free slots.

3. **If it flags stale entries** (servers dead or the worktree missing on disk), check
   whether the worktree still exists on disk before offering to clean it:
   - **Tree still there** (servers just died — a reboot, a crash) → the work in it is
     intact, so offer to **restart it in place** rather than remove it:
     ```bash
     node scripts/worktree/up.mjs <feature> [ng|trm] --restart
     ```
   - **Tree gone / work already landed** → clean the entry. For each stale slot the
     user confirms:
     ```bash
     cd /c/dev/MPS_NG && node scripts/worktree/down.mjs <slot> --remove
     ```
     (omit `--remove` to just free the slot while keeping the worktree on disk).
